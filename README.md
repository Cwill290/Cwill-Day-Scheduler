# Cwill-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This project helped me learn to use different API resources. The app will let you plan your work day as well as color code the schedule
based on what time of day it is. I had fun putting this one together and learned a lot of useful information.

## Usage

https://cwill290.github.io/Cwill-Day-Scheduler/

Enter in any tasks you have for your work day and save the entries with the button on the right of the column.
The page will store you entries and color code the hour blocks depending on what time of day it is.
Very useful for organizing your day!
